# Permalist-App

A streamlined item management app built with **JavaScript**, **EJS**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Axios**.

Users can add, update, and delete entries from a personalized permanent list. The app uses **PostgreSQL** for backend data storage and **Axios** to seamlessly communicate with the server and push results to the interface.

Ideal for simple list tracking with solid architecture behind the scenes.
